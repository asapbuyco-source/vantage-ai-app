probability_engine.py
────────────────────
Weighted model combiner.
Merges Poisson, Elo, and Form probabilities into a single consensus.

Weights: 60% Poisson | 30% Elo | 10% Form

MODEL-07: Probability calibration layer added.
Before this fix, model probabilities were systematically 10-30% too high
(O2.5 predicted 92% → actual 82%, BTTS No predicted 88% → actual 58%).
Calibration factors are empirical discounts derived from 30-day backtest data.
These are applied BEFORE EV calculation and Kelly staking, fixing the entire
decision chain: overconfident prob → inflated EV → oversized Kelly → blow-ups.

CAL-02: Per-market confidence scores added.
The old confidence_score was Shannon entropy of 1X2 outcomes — meaningless for
80% of bets which are on goals markets. Three new per-market agreement scores:
  - result_confidence: entropy of 1X2 (unchanged logic, renamed)
  - goals_confidence: 1 - CV of over/under probability spread
  - btts_confidence: 1 - |P(BTTS) - P(H)*P(A)| (measures Poisson-grid coherence)
Safety downgrades now use the appropriate per-market confidence score.
